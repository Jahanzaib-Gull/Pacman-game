# Complete 2D Pac-Man Game in C++!

I'm proud to share my latest console-based Pac-Man game built entirely in C++! This project goes beyond basic movement - it features authentic gameplay mechanics, intelligent enemies, and proper win/lose conditions just like the original.

## Core Gameplay Features:
🎯 Objective: Eat all 100 dots while avoiding 4 unique ghosts
🏆 Win Condition: Clear the maze of all dots to trigger a victory screen
💀 Lose Condition: Lose all 3 lives to get a game over screen
⚡ Power-Ups: Energizers (O) make ghosts vulnerable for 30 moves

## Advanced Technical Implementation:

### 👻 Smart Ghost AI:

Ghost 1: Patrols vertically (up/down)
Ghost 2: Patrols horizontally (left/right)
Ghost 3: Moves randomly
Ghost 4: Actively chases Pac-Man

### 🕹️ Precise Controls:

WASD-based movement with wall collision
Screen-wrapping at maze edges
Real-time keyboard input detection

### 📊 Game State Management:

Score tracking (1pt per dot, 5pts per energizer)
Lives counter with respawn mechanic
Countdown timer for power-up effects

## Development Insights:

### This project helped me master:

✔ Object collision and boundary checking
✔ Finite state machines for game logic
✔ AI pathfinding and decision-making

### challenge

The biggest challenge was balancing ghost behaviors to create fair but challenging gameplay. I'm particularly proud of the different ghost personalities that make each playthrough unique!
